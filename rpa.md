```rpa
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of software 
robots or "bots" to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks within business 
processes. RPA technology allows organizations to streamline their 
operations, improve efficiency, and reduce human error by automating 
manual tasks that are time-consuming and prone to mistakes.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that uses software robots 
or "bots" to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks that were previously 
performed by humans. UiPath is one of the leading RPA platforms that 
enables organizations to create, deploy, and manage these software robots. It 
provides a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features for automating 
various processes across different industries.
