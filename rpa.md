Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that uses software robots (bots) to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks in business processes. These bots interact with digital systems and applications, simulating human actions such as data entry, processing transactions, sending emails, and extracting information from documents. RPA helps businesses increase efficiency, reduce errors, and free up human workers for more strategic tasks.
# 2. Five Applications of RPA:
* Data Entry and Migration: Automating the transfer of data between systems, such as from legacy systems to new databases.
* Invoice Processing: Automating the process of reading invoices, matching them with purchase orders, and making payments.
* Customer Service: Automating customer queries through chatbots or processing customer requests such as order tracking.
* HR Tasks: Automating employee onboarding, payroll processing, and benefits administration.
* Compliance and Auditing: Automating compliance checks and audits by analyzing data from various systems and generating reports.
# 3. Risks in RPA:
* Data Security Risks: Bots may handle sensitive data, and inadequate security measures can lead to breaches.
* Bot Failures: If an automated process encounters an unexpected scenario, it can fail, leading to operational delays.
* Scalability Issues: Scaling RPA solutions across large organizations may lead to complexities in managing multiple bots.
* Compliance Risks: Incorrectly programmed bots may not comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
* Employee Resistance: There may be resistance from employees fearing job loss due to automation.
# 4. Future of RPA:
The future of RPA is expected to be driven by its integration with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, leading to more intelligent automation solutions. RPA will evolve from handling simple rule-based tasks to automating more complex decision-making processes. It will play a key role in digital transformation, enabling businesses to increase productivity, reduce operational costs, and provide better customer experiences. Cloud-based RPA, cognitive automation, and enhanced security measures will be at the forefront of RPA advancements.
# 5. Interface Variables:
Interface variables are used to define the properties or parameters that allow communication between different parts of a system or application. In RPA, interface variables enable interaction between bots and external applications or systems by passing data or controlling inputs and outputs. They facilitate the integration of the automated workflow with other systems, making the process more efficient and seamless.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is widely used across various industries to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks. Below are RPA use cases for the key sectors you've listed:
# Longs
# 1. Write a note on History of Automation.
We are entering the fourth industrial revolution, the era of comprehensive automation. RPA, 
as a driver of this revolution, inherits cloud deployment features and mimics human cognition 
with unattended automation mechanics. Thousands of enterprises across the globe have 
already implemented the technology. To better see why it happened, let’s trace back the 
significant stages of the RPA development that made the technology what it is today.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31abb189-492f-41dd-bf33-f1b8f6efcf74)
## The 1990s: Adopting automation for UI testing
The story of RPA started with the automation of user interface (UI) testing. It usually means 
testing visual elements of interfaces to make sure they work correctly, and a user won’t 
encounter any issues working with the app.
Back in the 90s, few computer models were on the market, especially compared to nowadays. 
However, the primary typical computer user persona started to shift from giant corporations’ 
and governmental organizations’ employees to ordinary home-based users. This was mainly 
due to the emergence of Windows 95, the canonical operating system of that time. As a 
result, the shift kickstarted UI testing development as the requirements and screen sizes 
became more diverse.
At the end of the 90s – early 2000s, companies came to the agile development concept, one 
of the key values of which is prioritizing people over processes and tools. Organizations also 
recognized the need to speed up their operations to stay competitive. Thus, various UI testing 
and quality assurance (QA) automation scripts were born out of necessity.
## The 2000s: Banking and insurance automation
A big part of this was screen scraping technology, which is the automation of extracting 
data from an application to use it for other purposes. It significantly boosted the efficiency 
and effectiveness of businesses that had to handle large amounts of data.
No wonder banks and insurance companies were among the first to embrace the idea.
Another reason why banks and insurance companies were the pioneers of automation is that 
they had resources available. However, automation technologies still had their drawbacks. 
One of them was a high entry threshold. If a company wanted to automate its processes at 
that time, it would likely result in building a complex IT environment. The latter required 
expensive engineering skills and time-consuming integrations.
## The 2010s: Enterprise automation
The real pivotal point for the RPA technology occurred around 2012, when the technology 
was finally officially recognized by large-scale businesses. There was a combination of 
factors that made it possible, such as:
* Due to the recent financial crisis, businesses sought ways to reduce expenses.
* Businesses realized the need for digital transformation, and RPA was considered an 
easy and affordable (in corporate rates, of course) solution for going digital.
These factors led to RPA taking the world by storm as more and more enterprises started 
adopting RPA for their mission-critical tasks.
## Now: Mid-market and SMB automation
The 2020s are truly the time of RPA democratization and the growing impact of RPA on all 
segments of economics. The democratization is possible through the gradual departure from 
costly licensing fees previously only affordable to enterprises to building partnerships with 
managed service providers to enable the RPA-as-a-service model. It allows RPA technology 
to expand to smaller businesses, providing SMBs with massive productivity outcomes.
We already see more and more evidence of RPA in SMBs moving from pilots and proof of 
concepts to real-time production in much shorter times than Enterprises do. According to the 
2021 report by Xerox, one of the largest ElectroNeek partners, 80% of SMB leaders saw 
automating tasks and processes as crucial to their survival, with two-thirds planning on 
upgrading their automation tools.

Demographics are also crucial. Since millennials and zoomers are in the workforce, they 
want interesting, challenging tasks, not monotonous jobs. With the help of RPA bots, 
companies can easily automate the work of many departments and specialists. When 
automation is efficiently implemented for tedious, repetitive tasks, employees become more 
efficient compared to previous years.

The changes in demographics and an MSPs’ focus on building recurring revenue drive the 
popularity of a bots-by-subscription business model. With this model, clients make periodic 
payments to MSPs instead of substantial upfront costs, which allows an even wider variety of 
companies to access the benefits of RPA.
# 2. What is Scope of RPA with real world industry use cases.

accuracy and reduce compliance risks while reducing time-consuming tasks.
Their use of RPA and Intelligent Automation has saved them time and human capacity 
equating to over £1 million which they’ve been able to reinvest back in the business.
That’s just a glimpse into what RPA can achieve for a business in the manufacturing or 
automotive industry.
### RPA Use Cases in the Public Sector
The public sector is essential for the well-being of the public. That means it needs to run 
efficiently so that people can get the help and support they need from the government.
The challenge is that companies in this industry are always short on time and short on budget. 
Automation can help give them both back, at least in part.
These are some of the ways RPA helps the public sector to enable better care of the public 
and their workforce:
* Data capture and analysis (surveys and census management)
* Statutory process automation
* Content migration
* Registration office processing and administration
* Grant application processing, permitting, reporting and compliance
Norfolk County Council relies on RPA to give them back 133 hours that would have been 
spent on manually processing employee payroll.
### RPA Use Cases in Energy & Utilities

spend more time doing what they do best—speaking to customers and sharing other services 
with them.
The RPA software robots, alongside natural-language AI, have been trained to read and sort 
emails on Utilita’s behalf. They do this for 12,500 emails a month.
### RPA Use cases in Retail
The success of retail companies hinges on having happy, repeat customers. There are a lot of 
digital processes that go into making that happen.
Customer queries need to be responded to, new prospective customers need to be marketed 
to, inventory needs to be carried and managed, etc.
That’s why retail is ripe for RPA support.
Here are the most common use cases for the retail industry:
* Demand-supply planning
* Product categorization

John Lewis turns to RPA to ward off fraudsters. The software bots (turned digital workers 
with the assistance of AI) were able to run 20,000 forensic fraud checks in one week. This 
gave John Lewis employees 100 hours back they could spend on more strategic projects.
### RPA Uses cases in Telecoms
Many companies in the telecommunications industry are combating new innovative 
technologies with outdated processes. That puts them on the back foot, scrambling to keep 
up. With RPA they can get ahead of customer demand and the competition.
Here are some use case examples in the telecoms industry:
* Network management customer onboarding or offboarding
* Data transformation
* Debt collection
* Expense control
* First Call Resolution (FCR)
# 3. Explain the Limitation of RPA implementations.
When technologies such as robotic process automation (RPA) were introduced years 
ago, they were lightyears ahead of the manual business processes in place at the time. As 
a result, they were often viewed as the end-all-be-all solution for the future. As 
organizations began implementing RPA solutions, many experienced excellent results –
and yet, as implementations have matured, companies are now experiencing RPA 
limitations.
## Struggling With Less-Than-Perfect Structures
While RPA has automated and accelerated the processing of highly structured, repetitive and 
predictable tasks for many organizations, companies are now realizing how many of their 
needs revolve around automating less-than-perfect documentation.
For example, although many forms in the insurance industry are standardized, the completion 
of these forms are not always ideal. Missing information, poor scan or fax quality and slightly 
skewed selection boxes mean that a high percentage of automated processing ends up on a 
human being’s desk to be manually handled.
## Skyrocketing Developer Costs
RPA implementations are often high-touch and high-maintenance as far as the IT resources 
required - even for simple tasks. As a result, the skyrocketing salaries of developers have 
taken a significant bite out of the expected return on investment that a company hopes to 
achieve with RPA.
Labor challenges that are especially pronounced in the IT industry mean that attracting, 
retaining, training and compensating IT professionals are more costly than ever today. Even 
if an RPA solution has an affordable price tag of $25,000; developer salaries that easily reach 
$200,000 per year can be prohibitive for many businesses.
In addition, when exceptions creep upwards because of RPA limitations, additional human 
resources are required to manage those exceptions.
## Failure to Scale
According to an article in Forbes, an “inherent RPA limitation is that it automates specific 
tasks — in other words, mimicking human behavior at the level of individual work.” 
Although this capability can make a big difference at the micro level, it doesn’t automatically 
scale to meet broad organizational digital transformation goals. 
Unless individual RPA improvements can be linked and support the overall company 
processes, they will remain only isolated elements at an individual task level. A contributing 
factor is that many RPA bots are innately complex, requiring too many decision points to be 
effective at a corporate level.
## In Search of a Holistic, Flexible, Integrated Solution
As more companies experience the limitations of RPA, they are seeking out a more robust, 
transformative, holistic solution that can harness the strengths of RPA while addressing its 
weaknesses.
Businesses should abandon non-core capabilities that will not generate an adequate ROI from 
RPA and focus instead on tasks that can affect organization-wide digital transformation. 
Selecting next-generation technologies that can manage less-than-perfect forms and 
documentation while kicking out fewer exceptions will maximize a company’s investment.

For example, the Digital Coworker from Roots Automation is well-versed in a wide 
variety of common forms and documents in the insurance industry, learning from every 
single customer for the benefit of future clients. In addition, customized tasks can be 
mastered quickly through machine learning technology. The Digital Coworker can read, 
review and interpret information like a human being much more so than conventional RPA 
solutions, providing greater flexibility and performance for today’s digitally forward 
organization.
# 4. What is automation, Distinguish between Automation and RPA.
it is hard to understand the differences between them. Let's start with the definitions:
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a software that is used to automate a high volume of 
repetitive and rule-based tasks. RPA tools allow users to design and deploy software robots 
that can mimic human actions. These tools also utilize pre-defined activities and business 
rules to autonomously execute a combination of tasks, transactions, and processes across 
software systems. RPA can deliver the desired result without human interaction.
On the other side, Traditional Automation is the automation of any repeated tasks. It 
combines application integration at a database or infrastructure level. It requires minimal 
human intervention.

![Screenshot 2024-09-09 234522](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f90b09d3-dd74-4ee2-8172-b7a12369dd90)

# 5. What is RPA? Benefits of RPA.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a software that is used to automate a high volume of 
repetitive and rule-based tasks. RPA tools allow users to design and deploy software robots 
that can mimic human actions. These tools also utilize pre-defined activities and business 
rules to autonomously execute a combination of tasks, transactions, and processes across 
software systems. RPA can deliver the desired result without human interaction.
## Benefits of RPA
The benefits of adopting the RPA systems range from boosting productivity, improving 
employee engagement, accelerating time to market, and generating more revenue. Successful 
RPA implementation can generate operational and strategic advantages.
When various tasks have to be differently processed, which adds costs as well as complexity, 
especially for large enterprises. But the benefits offered by RPA make this technology worth 
every penny:
## 1. RPA Gives Accuracy
Human error results in the loss of billions of dollars annually. Do you remember the simple 
typo that caused the stock market to plunge 1000 points and wipe out $1.1 trillion in 2010? 
To achieve the highest level of efficiency, it is important to eliminate errors. The average 
benchmark for data entry errors ranges from 2 to 5%. This risk is significantly elevated with 
tedious and repetitive tasks that induce boredom.
## 2. Productivity Enhancement
RPA never takes leaves or never goes on a vacation. They keep working tirelessly, round the 
clock, with consistency and efficiency.
The productive gains of RPA are real as well as measurable. According to a new study from 
the Information Services Group (ISG), a leading global technology research and advisory 
firm, RPA enables companies to execute processes 5-10 times faster with approx 37% fewer 
resources.
## 3. Time and Labor Saving
As per The National Association of Software and Services Companies, RPA reduces up to 
35-65% in labor costs and delivers a return on investment (ROI) in as few as six months.
## 4. Scalability
The robotic workforce can be as large or as small as per your requirement. The new bots can 
be deployed quickly, and that too at a minimum cost.
Whenever there is peak business activity like a new product launch, RPA can handle the 
improved transaction volume. This means there is no need to hire new staff and train them.
## 5. Improvement of Service Level
Businesses that deploy RPA to handle routine tasks can refocus their employees on 
creative, strategic work and deliver better customer service.
An intelligent way to integrate it into business operations is to allow the bots to work 
efficiently on tasks.
For example, you can improve service levels by automating tasks during customer 
interaction, reducing time to resolution, and decreasing customer frustration.
## 6. Flexibility & Adaptability
RPA is compatible with any software system. It mimics human action without coding 
changes, making it flexible and adaptable to virtually any business. ERP, CRM, and industryspecific applications are the best candidates for RPA.
# 6. Explain different Business Processes and use cases in RPA.
# 7. Describe Type of implementation methodologies.
A well-prepared implementation approach helps you to take full advantage of the 
technology. The Final RPA Implementation Journey involves the below-mentioned steps:
## Step 1: Program Initiation
A clear RPA business plan is a cornerstone of successful deployment. The program initiation 
phase helps an organization understand the feasibility and advantage of an RPA solution.
## Step 2: Assessing Potential Opportunities
The organization’s initial process assessment is essential to attain the best results. Make sure 
the focus is on:
* Input and output volume
* Process variability
* Value unlocked via automation
Volume and process variability should remain in equilibrium, directly affecting cost benefits. 
In addition, enterprises should consider data security, cybersecurity, and scalability during an 
evaluation for the implementation of RPA steps.
## Step 3: Developing Proof of Concept
After process selection, enterprises should experiment with robotic process automation 
tools and technologies to understand their work.
Aim at the key elements of the process and not the complete initiative. Cross-check if the bot 
has the caliber to work and deliver the best results. This will help create an effective proof of 
the complete concept and ensure the efforts don’t go in vain.
## Step 4: Deploy a Pilot
Once you attain conceptual proof, run the pilot. Implementing this step for RPA 
implementation further reduces bot deployment inefficiencies.
Deploying a pilot helps you understand if you are investing in the right software.
To ensure that, measure the bot’s performance vs. manual process. Then, keep running the 
traditional process against the bot. This process helps in proving its actual worth.
## Step 5: Resource Organization
Before pilot production, companies organize cross-functional project teams and resources. 
The responsibilities must be well-defined to ensure business goals are in sync. A successful 
strategy includes a plan where businesses should consider employees’ suggestions and 
potential impacts, and training programs are welcomed.
## Step 6. Setting up of an Implementation Plan
A comprehensive implementation plan with a detailed strategy is the need of the hour. A 
complete team of business analysts, project managers, operating staff, and RPA developers is 
necessary for the streamlined implementation of RPA. You also have to consider 
maintenance costs and additional software development costs.
## Step 7: Operate and Monitor
When bots are up and running, don’t forget to analyze their performance. Ensure they are not 
overloaded. Operational benefits and greater productivity are worth considering
# 8. Describe Stadardization of processes.
Business Process Standardization is the act of establishing a “Best Practice” of how to carry 
out a process and make sure that the entire organization follows it.
Standardization of the processes is done to gain their benefits or as part of a more significant 
initiative such as Business Process Management (BPM).
It helps to achieve componentization where you can re-use the same process, which is already 
established as a component of another process. This can range up to different areas/ 
departments of the same company.
## Standardization steps usually include
* Setting the standards
* Reporting on the standards for the management
* Adherence to the established standards
* Continuous improvement
## What RPA has to do with Process Standardization
* Robotic Process Automation (RPA) aims to replace highly manual, repetitive, rule-based 
processes that handle huge volumes of data.
* RPA is not a nail that we can use to fix a broken process that humans perform manually on 
a specific routine.
* Every RPA project should focus on some level of process standardization before any 
automation efforts.
## Why RPA Require Process Standardization
Characteristics of a Non-Standardized Process include:
* Increased error rate
* Decreased quality of routine tasks
* Inefficient tasks
* Excess repetitive tasks
* Reduced functionality
* High maintenance costs
* Less reliable end results
* High variability in output
* No clearly defined inputs and outputs
Automation of such processes will not gain the necessary improvement to the organization 
without the proper application of process standardization. RPA is also a technology that 
eliminates wastes DOWNTIME:
* D — Defects
* O — Overproduction
* W — Waiting
* N — Not utilizing talent
* T — Transportation
* I — Inventory excess
* M — Motion waste
* E — Excess processing

# 9. Discuss about Robotic control flow architecture.
The architecture of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a combination of several tools, 
platforms, and various infrastructure elements to form a complete RPA tool.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d3f9bb-efb7-4e33-a928-9669651495c6)
* Applications under robotic process execution – This is well suited for enterprises 
applications like ERP, SAP or any other record processing application. These applications 
are data intensive and they are loaded with repetitive tasks.
* RPA Tool – To develop software robots to the automation of applications in Desktop, 
Web and Citrix environment. Exception handling, ability to write to/from various data 
sources and to build reusable components.
* RPA Platform – RPA Software bots can be stored in a shared repository and they can be 
shared across software robots libraries. RPA platform has the ability to develop 
meaningful insights on the bots and execution process.
* RPA Execution Infrastructure – They act as a bank of parallel physical or virtual lab 
machines which are controlled based on usage patterns. Machine scale up or down in 
parallel to achieve the automation can also be performed.
* Configuration management – Updating of bots to a newer version is performed. 
Branching and merging of RPA bots are also performed since they are reusable across the 
libraries.
### RPA is a combination of various layers of application and tools that makes the whole architecture.
![Screenshot 2024-09-09 235954](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c5db272-af09-4ab0-b709-0f5abd075c4e)

# 10. Explain RDLC, Differentiate between RDLC and SDLC.
The RPA development life cycle is a blueprint that consists of the processes of the 
organization to be automated, the criteria to follow, the deployment of a bot, and constant 
monitoring once the bot is in place.
RPA process flow is approached in a segmented process to ensure each stage of RPA can be 
closely studied, assessed, and improved to enhance delivery, execution, and performance. 
The RPA implementation strategy typically consists of the following 6 phases.
## Identify
The first stage in RPA lifecycle development and testing is to identify the prospective 
business process or processes that can be automated through robotic processes. Remember not all processes can be automated thru robotic processes, yet.
For example, RPA prefers data in a structured format but more than 75% of data pertaining to any business is unstructured. Also, RPA is best suited for a rules-based process than a judgment-based one, even though artificial intelligence and machine learning can help to some extent with the exceptions of such rules.
Hence, it is important for RPA stakeholders together with the business teams to identify the correct processes that are viable for RPA development. Usually, RPA development follows a 
segmented agile and customized approach.
## Analyze
The second stage in the RPA process flow is to analyze the processes that are identified as 
potential candidates for automation. 
A process architect identifies the requirements for such processes after thoroughly analyzing 
the technical feasibility. The degree of automation is assessed in this stage based on the 
analysis and the various complexities involved in the identified processes such as- What is 
the saving factor in terms of time and money? Can this automation bring to the whole 
business process? Does this automation really improve the quality of the output? What is the 
business value this automation can deliver once it is put in place?
## Design
prepared.
As the name suggests, this PDD defines the sequence of steps involved in the process to be 
automated. This is also the stage in which the dependencies the automated process might 
have like the systems it interacts with or the regulations that impact it are identified and 
mapped. 
Next, a flowchart or the Object Model Diagram is prepared which illustrates the sequence of 
steps involved in the process to be automated.
## Develop
Once the process for RPA is identified and designed, the next step in the RPA lifecycle is to 
develop the automation scripts and codes using various RPA tools available according to the 
requirements and definitions arrived in the design phase.
There are various RPA tools available in the market such as Keysight’s Eggplant, Blue 
Prism, UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Pega, each offering a variety of capabilities.
These tools vary according to the requirement and the level of complexity that needs to be 
handled. The RPA developer identifies the best tool for the process and builds the bot 
accordingly.
## Test
In RPA lifecycle development and testing, once the bot is developed and ready, the same is 
tested to check whether the bot satisfies all the requirements and is performing as desired.
This post-development test phase is usually conducted by the testing team with QA. Once the 
bot passes the QA, the same is ready for deployment.
## Implement
The last stage in the RPA lifecycle is Implementation. Once the bot passes all the QA tests, it 
is ready to be deployed. All the components are tested for integrity. Any issues that arise are 
dealt with by going back to the development and testing stages for a possible resolution.
Once the bot is implemented, it is required to continuously monitor the bot for its 
performance and ensure it is running successfully with optimal capacity

# 11. Explain Centre of Excellence (CoE).
Organizations from around the globe are trying to implement RPA to improve the 
productivity of their business operations, reduce errors, and increase data security.
However, before you implement RPA and scale your use of it across the enterprise, you 
need to consider important factors such as the:
* Software infrastructure
* Organizational objectives
* Organizational structure
* Resources available
* Governance of the RPA initiative
Creating an RPA Center of Excellence can significantly improve your ability to achieve 
your automation goals, ensure you reap the full value of RPA, and maximize your ROI.
## RPA Center of Excellence:
A COE is a way to embed and implement RPA deeply and effectively into the 
organization. It enables organizations to gather, assess, and manage the necessary 
knowledge and capabilities needed to effectively implement RPA. By bringing together 
people from different disciplines, a CoE can combine learning and oversight around a 
specific area, driving the organizations to align multiple disciplines together.
The CoE is focused on providing training, best practices, and resources for the 
organization. It standardizes the rules and guidelines that govern development, thus 
ensuring that all projects are a driver of organizational outcomes.
## Why implement an RPA Center of Excellence:
Many organizations are realizing that implementing RPA at scale in silos is impossible. 
An RPA CoE brings people from various disciplines to share knowledge, collaborate, 
and develop automation in a more effective and streamlined manner. The CoE is 
designed to drive innovation, improvement, and collaboration - it enables teams to 
measure, experiment, and accelerate performance.
The RPA CoE is meant to drive all the functionalities of an RPA initiative to be 
successful. The model should include:
* Organization: Considering the CoE within the enterprise context will ensure that 
RPA properly implemented throughout the organization. The CoE will dictate internal 
and external roles and responsibilities that will support the RPA initiative.
* Governance: This establishes clear RPA standards, procedures, and policies along 
with governing bodies, escalation paths, and segregation of duties. It ensures that 
compliance regulation, security requirements, and regulatory standards are met. It will 
decide task prioritization and the level of access for different teams and employees.
* Technology: It’s up to the RPA CoE to choose the right automation tools for the 
appropriate tasks and take care of the maintenance of them. The CoE acts as the architect of the robotic operating environment. It will support RPA integration into 
critical areas such as IT Service Management and Configuration Management 
Database.
* Processes: The RPA CoE is in charge of evaluating automation opportunities, 
deploying RPA into suitable environments that are stable, scalable, and secure.
* Operations: If the implementation of RPA is successful, there are some structural 
changes that will have to occur. These changes which can include changing job 
descriptions of human roles and overall operational change management is managed 
by the RPA CoE.
## How to build the RPA Center of Excellence?
Organizations can build internal scalable, self-sustaining RPA models to embed RPA deeply 
and effectively into the organizations. Here is how to get started.
### Build a team for RPA
The heart of RPA CoE is the RPA operations Team. The team has defined roles and 
responsibilities. This team is responsible for implementing Organization-wide RPA.
1. RPA Project Manager
2. RPA Sponsor
3. RPA Analyst
4. RPA Architect
5. RPA Developer
6. RPA Infra
7. RPA Support
### Build a Technical and Functional Environment
Once the team is established, the technical and functional environment needs to be set up. 
From the tools that are required for implementation to the kind of configuration, 
performance, and connectivity requirements.
### Create an Effective Governance Model
The Governance Model for RPA CoE lays out consistent criteria, protocols, and regulations 
for robotic process automation together with regulatory structures, escalation pathways, and 
role segregation. The Governance Model also guarantees that legislation, the specifications 
for cyber management, and regulatory guidelines are fulfilled. It would also define the 
prioritization, the level of access granted to the RPA operation team, and others.
### RPA CoE Launch
Launch of RPA CoE with all the processes and the teams are focussing on making RPA part 
of the organization and all the strategic requirements are met. But it just doesn't stop here, 
constant feedback to scale up the RPA efforts and drive greater business outcomes.
# 12. Brief Discussion about Initiation Of RPA.
## 1.Don’t start small with RPA: Start micro
It’s conventional wisdom when starting from scratch with a new technology: Start small.
With RPA, the wisdom needs some modification: Start smaller.
“It sounds obvious, but most people get this wrong: Automate the small, easy processes
that you do a lot,” says Antony Edwards, COO at Eggplant. “Too many people start by
trying to automate the really long, gnarly process that only happens twice a month. This
is hard, takes a lot of time, is brittle, and has low value.”
What is micro RPA? Think about automating specific, small actions that take two to five
seconds to complete.
In fact, “small” might not be quite the right scope when you’re just starting out. Instead,
consider “micro RPA,” which Edwards describes as “automating specific, small actions
that take two to five seconds” to complete.
“This is more robust and will get you going,” Edwards says. “Then build up.”
It can be useful to think in terms of single tasks rather than large, end-to-end processes
when you’re getting going with RPA. In fact, RPA on its own can’t always necessarily
tackle end-to-end processes in their entirety, particularly if there are any steps in that
process that require creative or complex decision-making, or that are otherwise not a
good fit for RPA.
## 2. Look for high-value RPA candidates
As Edwards points out above, that byzantine process that only runs once or twice a
month probably isn’t your best fit for RPA, and it certainly not a good candidate for
square one.
Instead, look for tasks where you see (and can articulate to others) a valuable business
outcome via automation. The driving question of your evaluation process shouldn’t
solely be: Can we automate this? Rather, if the answer is yes, then you need to ask:
Should we automate this? You can spin up all sorts of variations of the same, such as:
What will we gain by automating this? If you can’t find a clear answer, that should give
you pause.
“Many organizations have a lot of ideas for automation candidates, but only a few of
them ask for the real business value,” says Tom Thaler, senior product manager, ARIS
at Software AG. “This prevents successful RPA implementation and can burn all
potential to grow.”
Look at highly repetitive steps in a larger process that are currently causing a lot of pain.
We’ve got an in-depth article for you on how to identify RPA opportunities. As a starting
point, though, map the “micro RPA” approach to highly repetitive steps in a larger
process that are currently causing a lot of pain.
“It’s essential to focus on the real weak points and bottlenecks of the end-to-end
processes right from the start,” Thaler says, adding that established techniques such as
process mining or business process analysis (BPA) can be useful ways to reliably
smoke out bottlenecks.
“This allows you to not only identify good automation candidates, but also to predict the
effect of automation on the business outcome,” he says.
## 3. Capture the process at a keystroke-and-click level
RPA is essentially software that can automate certain computer-based tasks that would
once have required a person to do manually with a keyboard and mouse. So, if you
want to create a robot or bot – the popular terms for this kind of software, not to be
confused with physical robots – you’re going to need to show it how to do its job.
“You then need to capture the process with all details on a click level, as this is required
for implementing the robot,” Thaler says.
Some 70 percent of RPA project resources are spent on this stage: Don’t let it become
a bottomless pit.
RPA bots on their own (unlike machine learning tools) can’t figure it out over time. So
shortchanging this phase could render your project DOA. The fundamental necessity of
this phase can create a different issue, however, one IT that leaders will want to keep in
mind: Based on experience, Thaler estimates that around 70 percent of RPA project
resources are spent on this stage.
“This phase may become a bottomless pit,” Thaler says. “The reason for this is you’ll
always have bias and [missing] information if you [only] talk to people, which leads to a
number of workshops and iterations until everything is covered.”
Certainly, talking with your team is a good way to identify bottlenecks and other pain
points. Thaler points to task mining or process mining as a more complete approach to
RPA discovery, one that doesn’t solely rely on anecdotal input.
“[This] can prevent bias and allow you to learn from the daily work of your employees,”
Thaler explains. “From there, it’s easy to implement the first robot – and also the
second, third, fourth, and so on.”
It’s important to note that RPA won’t magically improve a broken process; it will just
automate – or attempt and then fail to automate – a broken process. Process
optimization needs to happen in the real world before you implement RPA.
## 4. Define how you’ll measure RPA performance
As with most IT initiatives, your RPA program is more likely to founder or outright fail if
you have nothing in place to measure its progress. This is not something you should
figure out months or years down the road.
“Build an enterprise business case to determine ROI for your RPA efforts,” advises
Chris Huff, chief strategy officer at Kofax. Huff has seen success, at Kofax and
previously while implementing RPA while leading Deloitte’s public sector robotics and
intelligent automation practice, with a four-pillar framework for a holistic business case.
It should cover:
Strategic alignment to the larger enterprise strategy
Workforce impact
Operational metric impact
Financial profile/impact
Huff is also a proponent of the Center of Excellence approach for ensuring long-term
RPA success. In your baby-steps stage, you should at least be planning to capture your
results in a meaningful way.
Workforce impact alone is a good motivation not to skimp on this step early in your
project. Automation anxiety is real. Communicating quantitative and qualitative RPA
results will be key to alleviating it, as well as for getting the kind of buy-in necessary to
grow the program beyond its infancy.
# 13. What are the factors affecting in Implementing the RPA at the enterprise level? Explain.
Automation is not new and in today’s business world automation is everywhere. But the
proliferation of automation artificial intelligence tools continues to grow leaps and
bounds. While Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a viable option when organizations
have to replace or assist manual workers, it doesn’t mean that RPA is the solution to all
of the business problems. It might be tempting to dive headlong into automation just
because others are into it only to realise that you have burnt your finger in the process.
Before you plunge right in, there are a few things you have to keep in mind.
* (1) Understand the process you are automating The most important step is figuring out
which processes you want to automate and which could be best solved by RPA. You
can evaluate automation process either by yourself or with the support of consultants,
system integrators, and business process outsourcing companies. Take time to evaluate
the process, and where necessary, change it.
* (2) Charter a clear roadmap Start with a clear list of benefits and limitations of robotic
process automation to business stakeholders. Much disappointment starts when you
apply tools in less than optimal ways or apply it to wrong processes. Start by asking
which processes are suitable for RPA? Is there a software/tool that is already available
for the activity you are trying to automate? How will you monitor the Robots activities?
What would you do if the RPA tool malfunctions or stops?
* (3) Choose the right tool There are a number of robotic process automation software
available on the market today. Some robotic process automation tools support
unattended automation while others run as a robotic desktop application, some come
with their own metalanguage, while some have a record button to make a pass at the
typical path of a process, some come with configurable dedicated process automation
tools while some have no pre-programmed processes. Enterprise architecture and
technology leaders must understand the differences in technical functionality of the
robotic process automation tools to select the right software platform. Remember there
may not be a single tool available that may meet all your requirements.
* (4) Get your teams ready First and foremost formalize your IT teams’ involvement as
early as possible. This is necessary to get maximum business value. They need to
understand why robotic process automation is different from the other tools and what
security measures have to be taken care in deployment. Identify any potential gaps in
skills and prioritize them by impact and need and hire necessary skill sets and expertise
in automation to fit your purpose. Help your technical teams adopt the new technology.
It is not just enough if you automate and leave, it has to be adopted by the team. People
do not embrace change easily. Identify and build necessary skills and provide enough
training to any workflow automation you introduce.
* (5) Standardize your environment Automating a diverse environment is complex. This is
because to ensure that each step is executed and completed successfully you need
workflow checks and balances in place which results in longer, highly risky and more
complex processes. But in a standardized environment, the processes are simpler
because automation is done in a known state and the time and effort required are less.
The standardized environment also reduces risks of errors, requires fewer support
requirements and skills, and improves logging, tracking and performance analysis.
* (6) Ensure proper review Estimate the amount of work a robot needs to perform. This
has to be carefully defined and tested. Testing is critical to success. Activities that
advent frequent changes may not be suitable for robotic process automation. During
production, continuously monitor. Dashboards might come in handy.
* (7) Curtail costs Automation investments go beyond just investing in the tool. More often
the process of automation may cost twice as much as the tool itself. Manage carefully
cost for implementation, setup and customization. Depending on the project scale,
diversity and complexity the cost will vary. Be careful not to allow for scope creep. For
this, you have to ensure that your objectives are clear and well-defined.
* (8) Calculate ROI of automation Automation isn’t easy. Estimate the time and cost
savings that automating a process will give and compare it with the actual time and cost
it has taken to automate. This will give you the Return on your Investment (ROI).
Prioritize automating processes that will save you the most time and at the same time
provide the biggest ROI.
* (9) Quality matters Define high quality control standards. Like any other computer
systems, automation software will also have its own bugs. A poorly defined automation
procedure can introduce issues much faster than any human process and its
implications could be widespread and damaging. To realise the value of automation, it
must be treated like any other software development process and include requirements,
scoping, acceptance testing, validation, support and revision tracking.
* (10) Think futuristic Don’t plan for short-term automations, have a long time goal in
mind. Always make sure that the solution you employ has the flexibility to adapt to
future changes. Service providers have been investing in automation for a long time but
only recently automation has gained priority. According to Gartner, ‘Through 2021, cost
savings from automation will range from 2% and 5% which will further the ongoing
deployment of automation”. However, don’t just focus on reducing labor costs while
going in for automation. There are many more factors to consider before you automate.
It is wise to consider all the factors before you automate!

# 14. Describe the environments setup for RPA Implementation.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is new to the industry. Most of the implementations
start with Proof of Concept (POC). POC is right way to start on any new technology or
concept. It gives organization an idea about the capabilities, benefits and challenges
with the new tools and technology. While working on POC, there are lot of concessions
made and not all organization’s procedures or policies are followed. As POC starts
getting stable and RPA code move towards implementation, discussion starts about
production implementation. It is big transition from POC to actual production
implementation. Every organization make some concessions or allows nonstandard
approaches for POC but when time comes for production implementation it is totally
different ball game. Lot of parties and stakeholders are involved in this and with strict
organization policies, procedures and SLAs.
Infrastructure setup one of most neglected areas during POC. RPA environment setup
should be based on organization’s processes and policies. Infrastructure setup are very
strict and tightly controlled by different groups. First step is to create a list of tool and capabilities, work with vendors for suggested step in different environments (Dev, Test,
Prod). Following are some of the points to consider while deciding on infrastructure:
* 1. Licensing of RPA tool – Does organization has licenses for tool to step in
multiple environments. Licensing terms are different for each tool vendor so this needs
to be discussed and appropriate licenses should be acquired for Dev and Test
* 2. RPA tool support for Virtual Environment – Infrastructure setup depends on
organization processes and procedures. Most of the organizations are moving towards
Virtual machines or cloud. RPA tools needs to be evaluated for VM and Cloud setup and
support.
* 3. Application access on servers – If the setup is done on VM server, application
capabilities should be tested. Some applications are not compatible with server and
sometimes servers have additional restriction which create issues down the line.
* 4. Security Policy – desktop and VM may have different security policies. VM
security policies should be looked at and make sure that it will not interfere in
application and RPA tool functionality.
* 5. Software update policies – Software update policies needs to be discussed.
Infrastructure team should consider RPA team as stakeholder. Software update may
create issues for RPA automation. These updates should be tested in lower level
environments before putting in production.
* 6. Access restrictions on higher level environments – As the access
management best practice, access restriction should be in place for higher level
environments. Access should be granted based on business needs and it should be
based on organization policies
* 7. Access for supporting tools – Most of the RPA implementations have some
support tools like OCR, Microsoft Office, emails etc. These supporting tools should
follow the infrastructure setup as RPA.
* 8. Supporting application server versions – Some applications may have different
version of desktop and server. If infrastructure is setup on VM servers, this point also
should be kept in mind.
* 9. AD groups – If possible, access request should be based on AD groups. Groups
should be created for different user’ groups and appropriate access should be granted
to each group. This is also a onetime activity but helps a lot in managing
## Best Practices for environment setup
* Start early – Infrastructure setup should not be an afterthought. It should start while
working on POC. This should start early in the lifecycle. Generally, infrastructure setup
SLAs are longer and multiple levels of approval are needed. Early start on setup and
design will help the project a lot.
* Distinct Environments - These should be 3 or more swim lanes of environments.
Environment setup is onetime activity and needs to be carefully planned and
implemented. Once infrastructure setup is done properly it helps to speed up
deployment of new functionality and processes. It seems complex or time-consuming
activity, but it pays in long run. It also reduces risk of cross connection and shields
production environment from inadvertent change or access.
* Runtime Resource setup – Every environment should have at least 1 runtime
resource. Runtime resource setup should match production setup in terms of types of
workstation (Server/VDI), version of software, screen resolution etc. This helps in
testing and reduces getting errors in higher environments.
* Code Promotion – Code packages should be promoted from Dev to test and prod. No
code changes should be allowed in test and prod environments. This helps keeping
code in sync in all environments.
* Monitoring and infrastructure maintenance – Production environment should be
monitored and maintained on a regular basis. Proper downtime schedule should be
place and activities check list should be in place during downtime like restart of runtime
resources, clearing log files, check space etc.
* Infra types to implement the RPA:
When implementing RPA, there are several infrastructure types that organizations can
consider based on their specific needs and preferences. Here are some common
infrastructure options for RPA implementation:
* On-Premises Infrastructure:
This refers to setting up RPA infrastructure within the organization's premises. It
typically involves deploying the necessary hardware, servers, and networking
components on-site. On premises infrastructure offers organizations complete control
over their RPA environment, data security, and integration with existing systems.
However, it requires substantial upfront investment, ongoing maintenance, and
scalability challenges.
