# 1. Define RPA
```rpa
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of software 
robots or "bots" to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks within business 
processes. RPA technology allows organizations to streamline their 
operations, improve efficiency, and reduce human error by automating 
manual tasks that are time-consuming and prone to mistakes.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that uses software robots 
or "bots" to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks that were previously 
performed by humans. UiPath is one of the leading RPA platforms that 
enables organizations to create, deploy, and manage these software robots. It 
provides a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features for automating 
various processes across different industries.

The history of RPA
We are entering the fourth industrial revolution, the era of comprehensive automation. RPA, 
as a driver of this revolution, inherits cloud deployment features and mimics human cognition 
with unattended automation mechanics. Thousands of enterprises across the globe have 
already implemented the technology. To better see why it happened, let’s trace back the 
significant stages of the RPA development that made the technology what it is today.

The 1990s: Adopting automation for UI testing
The story of RPA started with the automation of user interface (UI) testing. It usually means 
testing visual elements of interfaces to make sure they work correctly, and a user won’t 
encounter any issues working with the app.
Back in the 90s, few computer models were on the market, especially compared to nowadays. 
However, the primary typical computer user persona started to shift from giant corporations’ 
and governmental organizations’ employees to ordinary home-based users. This was mainly 
due to the emergence of Windows 95, the canonical operating system of that time. As a 
result, the shift kickstarted UI testing development as the requirements and screen sizes 
became more diverse.
At the end of the 90s – early 2000s, companies came to the agile development concept, one 
of the key values of which is prioritizing people over processes and tools. Organizations also 
recognized the need to speed up their operations to stay competitive. Thus, various UI testing 
and quality assurance (QA) automation scripts were born out of necessity.

The 2000s: Banking and insurance automation
A big part of this was screen scraping technology, which is the automation of extracting 
data from an application to use it for other purposes. It significantly boosted the efficiency 
and effectiveness of businesses that had to handle large amounts of data.
No wonder banks and insurance companies were among the first to embrace the idea.
Another reason why banks and insurance companies were the pioneers of automation is that 
they had resources available. However, automation technologies still had their drawbacks. 
One of them was a high entry threshold. If a company wanted to automate its processes at 
that time, it would likely result in building a complex IT environment. The latter required 
expensive engineering skills and time-consuming integrations.

The 2010s: Enterprise automation
The real pivotal point for the RPA technology occurred around 2012, when the technology 
was finally officially recognized by large-scale businesses. There was a combination of 
factors that made it possible, such as:
 Due to the recent financial crisis, businesses sought ways to reduce expenses.
 Businesses realized the need for digital transformation, and RPA was considered an 
easy and affordable (in corporate rates, of course) solution for going digital.
These factors led to RPA taking the world by storm as more and more enterprises started 
adopting RPA for their mission-critical tasks.

Now: Mid-market and SMB automation
The 2020s are truly the time of RPA democratization and the growing impact of RPA on all 
segments of economics. The democratization is possible through the gradual departure from 
costly licensing fees previously only affordable to enterprises to building partnerships with 
managed service providers to enable the RPA-as-a-service model. It allows RPA technology 
to expand to smaller businesses, providing SMBs with massive productivity outcomes.
We already see more and more evidence of RPA in SMBs moving from pilots and proof of 
concepts to real-time production in much shorter times than Enterprises do. According to the 
2021 report by Xerox, one of the largest ElectroNeek partners, 80% of SMB leaders saw 
automating tasks and processes as crucial to their survival, with two-thirds planning on 
upgrading their automation tools.

Demographics are also crucial. Since millennials and zoomers are in the workforce, they 
want interesting, challenging tasks, not monotonous jobs. With the help of RPA bots, 
companies can easily automate the work of many departments and specialists. When 
automation is efficiently implemented for tedious, repetitive tasks, employees become more 
efficient compared to previous years.

The changes in demographics and an MSPs’ focus on building recurring revenue drive the 
popularity of a bots-by-subscription business model. With this model, clients make periodic 
payments to MSPs instead of substantial upfront costs, which allows an even wider variety of 
companies to access the benefits of RPA.
