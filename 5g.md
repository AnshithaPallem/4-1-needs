# 1. **Define Speed and Latency of 5G**

- **Speed:** 5G offers theoretical download speeds up to 20 Gbps (Gigabits per second). In real-world scenarios, typical speeds range from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps, depending on the network and location. This is much faster than 4G, making it suitable for high-bandwidth applications like streaming 4K video, virtual reality, and cloud computing.
  
- **Latency:** 5G networks aim to have ultra-low latency, often as low as **1 millisecond** (ms). Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination. Low latency is crucial for applications like autonomous driving, remote surgery, and real-time gaming, where instant responses are needed.

# 3. **What is the Purpose of a CMDB (Configuration Management Database)?**

- A **Configuration Management Database (CMDB)** is a repository that stores information about IT infrastructure and services. It tracks the configuration items (CIs), such as hardware, software, networks, and services, and their relationships.
  
- **Purpose:**
  - To manage and track changes to IT assets and their dependencies.
  - To provide accurate data for incident and problem management.
  - To facilitate decision-making and impact analysis for changes.
  - To improve service management by understanding relationships and dependencies between CIs.

# 4. **What is the Purpose of mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications)?**

- **mMTC** refers to one of the key use cases of 5G, designed to connect a massive number of IoT devices in dense environments.
  
- **Purpose:**
  - To support large-scale, low-power, low-data-rate communication for IoT devices.
  - To allow billions of devices to connect efficiently, such as sensors, smart meters, and industrial IoT applications.
  - To ensure long battery life and minimal data traffic, focusing on reliable, cost-effective connectivity for a massive number of devices.

# 5. **What is Self Clustering?**

- **Self-Clustering** refers to an algorithm or system where nodes or data points automatically form clusters or groups based on their similarities without external control.
  
- **Purpose:**
  - It is used in machine learning, networking, and sensor networks where entities (nodes, data points) can autonomously organize into clusters to optimize communication, reduce energy consumption, or classify data.

# 6. **Define Augmented Reality (AR)**

- **Augmented Reality (AR)** is a technology that overlays digital information (such as images, sounds, or text) onto the real world through devices like smartphones, AR glasses, or tablets.

- **Examples:**
  - Apps that overlay navigation directions onto streets in real-time.
  - Games like Pok√©mon Go, where virtual objects are placed in the real environment.
  - AR in retail, where customers can visualize how furniture looks in their home.
