# 1. **Define Speed and Latency of 5G**

- **Speed:** 5G offers theoretical download speeds up to 20 Gbps (Gigabits per second). In real-world scenarios, typical speeds range from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps, depending on the network and location. This is much faster than 4G, making it suitable for high-bandwidth applications like streaming 4K video, virtual reality, and cloud computing.
  
- **Latency:** 5G networks aim to have ultra-low latency, often as low as **1 millisecond** (ms). Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination. Low latency is crucial for applications like autonomous driving, remote surgery, and real-time gaming, where instant responses are needed.
